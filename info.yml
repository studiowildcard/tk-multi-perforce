# Metadata defining the behaviour and requirements for this app

# expected fields in the configuration file for this app
configuration:

    connect_on_startup:
        type: bool
        description: If set to True then the app will establish a connection at
                     start-up and present the connection/password dialog to the
                     uesr if needed.
        default_value: False

    desktop_app_only:
        type: bool
        description: If set to True the app will only load the apps that are
                     meant to appear in the SG Desktop Application and hide the others.
        default_value: False

    hook_scene_operation:

        difficult due to bandwidth or infrastructural restrictions.
